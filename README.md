# SOEN-6441 - WARZONE RISK GAME

[![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/RRK1000/SOEN-6441/actions/workflows/gradle-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/RRK1000/SOEN-6441/actions/workflows/gradle-ci.yml)

This project is a command line implementation of the [warzone](https://www.warzone.com/) game for [Concordia University's](https://www.concordia.ca/) SOEN 6441 course, Advanced Programming Practices.
Warzone applies the concept of Risk, where a world map is defined as a connected graph and the goal of the players is to take over all the countries. Each player is assigned a certain number of armies at each turn and they can attack their neighboring countries to capture them. The orders given by players are executed in a round-robin fashion, until 1 player owns all the countries.
